### App Flow

App uses core data for saving data localy
- For title app uses user email
- If user don't have any reminders we empty screen to show
- If user have some reminders, UITableView will be shown with that reminders
- User can see all categories listed in UICollectionView in CategoryViewController
- Also user can see reminders if he click on some category from CategoryViewController
- User can checked or unchecked every reminder

|      | Main Screens     |
|---                  |---   |
| Home View Controller            | User can see table of all reminders |
